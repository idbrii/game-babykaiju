# babykaiju


A 2D platformer where you carry around a cute baby kaiju and feed it until it
grows into a rideable teen and then a full grown out of control monster.
Feeding it not too soon and not too late could be part of the puzzle of making
it through the level.

Similar to feeding baby yoshi: https://youtu.be/t6B30vCAlcU?si=FJi6_j3HrXKpJxHA&t=615


* You carry baby kaiju around and feed it berries/enemies until it eats enough
  to grow. You can put it down or toss it forward.
* When it's a teen, you ride it and that lets you jump higher or float or some
  different movement. It continues to eat everything that touches its face.
* When it grows again, it stomps forward, destroying anything in its path.
* Your abilities would be limited to run and jump so you rely on the kaiju.
* Goal is to make it to the end. But there might be small tunnels that you can
  only carry it through when it's a baby. Or spiky ground you need to ride it
  to across. So you're trying to find a balance of navigating the level and
  feeding it at the right times.
